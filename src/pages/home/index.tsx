        <p>
          Street children can have complex circumstances and are very vulnerable to exploitation and violence. Itâ€™s hard to reach them with vital services such as education and healthcare. They miss out on their right to education because they are trying to support themselves or their families, so less formal approaches might be needed to try to get them into learning.

            Why to sponsor street child?
          </h2>
          <p>
            there are those children who have a home but work on the streets as their only means of income. They beg, steal or perform small jobs like shoe-shining or selling items in the market to feed themselves and their family. These children often drop out of school and are much more likely to join gangs, steal and become addicted to drugs and alcohol.
